-- 7. From 1970 – 2016, what is the largest number of wins for a team that did not win the world series? 
-- What is the smallest number of wins for a team that did win the world series? 
-- Doing this will probably result in an unusually small number of wins for a world series champion – determine why this is the case. 
-- Then redo your query, excluding the problem year.
-- How often from 1970 – 2016 was it the case that a team with the most wins also won the world series? What percentage of the time?
